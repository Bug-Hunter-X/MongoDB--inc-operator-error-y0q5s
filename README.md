# MongoDB $inc operator error
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, in this example, a string is provided as the increment value, which will result in an error.

The solution shows the correct usage of the `$inc` operator, using a number to increment the field.
